# Zelda Lite Assignment

## Description
The task of the assignment was to add random generation of cermaic pots, that are able to be picked up, thrown and shatter upon impact on gameobjects. These thrown pots should
have the ability to damage and defeat enemies in the game. Another task apart of the assignment was letting defeated enemies drop hearts for the user to heal from. The game is a dungeon crawling game where each room is procedurally generated, putting random amount of enemies and cermaic pots where the player has to trigger a floor button to open the doors to proceed to the next dungeon room.

### Challenges Faced
- Creating new different game object types to work withs the existing code
- Creating a gamestate for creating the ability to throw the object towards things
- Focusing on data driven design, as a result getting the correct animations to play in the correct direction the player is facing
